### Assignment
(B) Modify the D3 Chord Visualization

Mike Bostock has made available at least two different versions of a Chord visualization. There is an earlier one which is written with with more direct d3 commands and gives you more control over the individual data points, and a later more packaged one that is easier to code:

Earlier version:

view-source:http://mbostock.github.io/d3/talk/20111116/bundle.html

Later, more packaged version:

A straightforward tutorial (recommended): http://soundsuggest.wordpress.com/2012/12/26/d3-js-javascript-library-chord-diagram-example/ (Links to an external site.) 
Long, involved tutorial (probably overkill): http://www.delimited.io/blog/2013/12/8/chord-diagrams-in-d3 (Links to an external site.) 

For this assignment, modify one of these d3 chord layout examples to visualization your own multi-dimensional data. Add your own elements to the chord e.g., use data on the periphery as filter for other charts, change the animation, change the way the arcs work in some manner.

To turn in:

A brief writeup:   Describe your code and the resulting visualization.  If you borrow code from anywhere, be sure to clearly list where in your writeup and comments.  
The code: in a zip file
A web link: To help with assessing this assignment we'd like everyone to make their assignment viewable via a web link somewhere.  Use your ischool account or any other web server to provide a runnable version of your code in addition to turning in the code files.
