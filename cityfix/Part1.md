Objectively Assessed Visualization Design

### Top Left:

A simple horizontal bar chart that displays the problem types on the y-axis with different colors being different years. The x-axis is the total number of requests in that year. I chose those one to enable quick, simple comparisons on the problem types in specific years. I think this might get a bit dense with information once I've actually seen the entire data set. If this is the case, I might try and pick out the ones that change the most year to year and de-emphasize those that do not.


### Top Right:

This would show changes over time for the total number of requests as well as the total coming from SeeClickFix. This would allow for easy correlation between what how the both are growing. Although it's not shown in the design, it could be interesting to see the number that are *not* coming from SeeClickFix(that would be a decreasing line). The reason I chose this design is that it would give us an idea of overall trends in the product and in the reporting of city problems. This is the "macro" view of what is going on.


### Bottom Left:

This radar chart is a different display of the information in top left. The number of requests, per category, by year. Since we only have a couple of years, this might be a great way to show with years are similar and which ones are not. Although I put down average days to close, this could also be days to close increase or decrease from the previous year with some baseline metric. We could also do an average of all the years as a baseline then compare each year to that average. The reason I think this would work well is that you can see how similar shapes manifest themselves, much more so than the top left graph. With regularity (like something month to month), you could see very easily whether or not it was a standard month or not.

### Bottom Right:

It might be interesting to see how different problem types have different response rates. This could be similar to the plot I've got at the top left of the original picture (as in grouped by year) or it could just be the totals. The reason I might choose this design is that it would give the viewer an easy way to understand how response times are change for certain problem types or for certain years(if grouped by years). I think we want to understand how SeeClickFix is affecting how users interact with their community. If more problems are getting reprted and response times are faster, that would be good. While the converse might raise some issues that need to be addressed.
